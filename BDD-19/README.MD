Derived views allow gradual evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do
not need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the
old schema and the new schema side by side as two independently derived views onto
the same underlying data. You can then start shifting a small number of users to the
new view in order to test its performance and find any bugs, while most users con‚Äê
tinue to be routed to the old view. Gradually, you can increase the proportion of
users accessing the new view, and eventually you can drop the old view
