- **Organizational Best Practices**
  - Clear folder structures
  - Separation of concerns
  - Documentation and coding standards

---

## Testing & QA Flow

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
- **QA Workflow**
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  - Automated testing pipelines
- **Git Flow Best Practices**
  - Branching strategies
  - Code reviews and pull requests

---

## Error Handling & Logging

- **Robust Error Handling**
  - Graceful degradation
  - User-friendly error messages
- **Effective Logging**
  - Log levels and categories
  - Centralized logging systems
  - Log rotation and management

---

## Docker Setup

- **Optimized Docker Images**
  - Multi-stage builds for smaller images
  - Caching strategies
- **Configuration Management**
  - Environment variables vs. arguments
  - Secure handling of secrets and credentials
- **Best Practices**
  - Minimal base images
  - Immutable infrastructure principles

---

## Deployment Strategy & Infrastructure

- **Deployment Strategies**
  - Rolling updates
  - Blue-green deployments
  - Canary releases
- **Infrastructure Sanity Checks**
  - Health checks and readiness probes
  - Resource allocation and scaling
- **Automation Tools**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Deployment scripts and orchestration

---

## Disaster Recovery & Monitoring

- **Disaster Recovery Planning**
  - Backup and restore procedures
  - Redundancy and failover mechanisms
- **Monitoring Systems**
  - Real-time metrics and dashboards
  - Alerting and notification setups
- **Tools and Technologies**
  - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
  - Cloud provider monitoring services

---

## Load & Smoke Testing

- **Load Testing**
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Stress testing under peak loads
- **Smoke Testing**
  - Basic functionality checks post-deployment
  - Automated smoke test suites
- **Tools**
  - JMeter, Locust for load testing
  - Selenium, Cypress for smoke testing

---

## Validation, Error Logs & Alerts

- **Input Validation**
  - Data sanitization and validation techniques
  - Preventing injection attacks
- **Error Logs**
  - Structured logging formats (JSON, etc.)
  - Correlation IDs for tracing requests
- **Alerts**
  - Setting up thresholds and triggers
  - Integration with communication channels (Slack, Email)
