# Production Checklist for Engineers

---

## Architecture & Organization

### Bad Example

- **Monolithic Codebase**
  - All code in a single folder
  - No separation of concerns
  - Difficult to maintain and scale

**Why It's Bad**
- Hard to navigate and understand
- Increases the risk of bugs
- Difficult for multiple developers to work simultaneously

### Best Practice

- **Modular Architecture**
  - Organize code into clear, logical folders (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`, `views/`)
  - Separate frontend and backend code
  - Implement layers (e.g., service layer, data access layer)

**Benefits**
- Easier maintenance and scalability
- Improved team collaboration
- Enhanced code reusability

## Databases & Indexing

### Bad Example

- **No Indexes on Database Tables**
  - Slow query performance
  - Full table scans even for simple queries

**Why It's Bad**
- Causes significant performance degradation as data grows
- Leads to high CPU and memory usage

### Best Practice

- **Proper Indexing**
  - Add indexes to columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`
  - Use composite indexes where appropriate

**Benefits**
- Faster query execution
- Reduced resource consumption
- Improved application responsiveness

  - Slow page load times

**Why It's Bad**
- Poor user experience due to slow loading
- Higher bandwidth costs

### Best Practice

- **Asset Optimization**
  - Minify and bundle JavaScript and CSS files
  - Compress images using formats like WebP
  - Implement lazy loading for images and components

**Benefits**
- Faster load times
- Better SEO rankings
- Enhanced user engagement

## Project Dependencies Version Lock

### Bad Example

- **Using Wildcard Versions**
  - Dependencies specified with "^" or "~" (e.g., `"lodash": "^4.0.0"`)
  - Allows automatic updates to new minor/patch versions

**Why It's Bad**
- Introduces risk of breaking changes
- Builds become non-reproducible over time

### Best Practice

- **Pin Exact Dependency Versions**
  - Use lock files like `package-lock.json` or `Pipfile.lock`
  - Specify exact versions (e.g., `"lodash": "4.17.21"`)

**Benefits**
- Consistent environments across all stages
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Controlled updates

**Why It's Bad**
- Increases likelihood of bugs reaching production
- Makes regression testing impractical

### Best Practice

- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**
  - Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
  - Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing

**Benefits**
- Early detection of defects
- Confidence in code changes
- Faster release cycles

## Error Handling & Logging

### Bad Example

- **Using `print` or `console.log` for Logging**
  - Scattered logs with inconsistent formats
  - No log levels or contexts

**Why It's Bad**
- Difficult to monitor and debug in production
- Important errors might be missed

### Best Practice

- **Structured Logging with Levels**
  - Use logging libraries (e.g., Winston, Log4j)
  - Implement log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
  - Include contextual information (e.g., request IDs)

**Benefits**
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Better insights into application behavior
- Facilitates centralized logging systems

## Docker Setup

### Bad Example

- **Large Docker Images**
  - Using full OS images like `ubuntu:latest`
  - Including unnecessary build tools in the final image

**Why It's Bad**
- Slow deployment and startup times
- Larger attack surface for security vulnerabilities

### Best Practice

- **Optimized Multi-Stage Builds**
  - Use minimal base images like `alpine`
  - Separate build and runtime stages

**Benefits**
- Smaller image sizes
- Faster deployments
- Improved security

---

## Interaction with External Services/Providers

### Bad Example

- **Hardcoding API Credentials**
  - API keys and secrets stored in code repositories
  - No error handling for failed external calls

**Why It's Bad**
- Security risks if credentials are exposed
- Application crashes when external services fail

### Best Practice

- **Secure and Resilient Integration**
  - Store credentials in environment variables or secret managers
  - Implement retries and fallback mechanisms
  - Respect API rate limits and handle exceptions gracefully

**Benefits**
- Enhanced security
- Improved application stability
- Compliance with external service policies

## Deployment Strategy & Infrastructure

### Bad Example

- **Manual Deployment Process**
  - Copying files via FTP or SSH
  - No version control of deployment artifacts

**Why It's Bad**
- Prone to human error
- Inconsistent deployments
- Difficult to roll back

### Best Practice

- **Automated Deployment Pipelines**
  - Use CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
  - Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform or Ansible
  - Use container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)

**Benefits**
- Consistent and repeatable deployments
- Faster release cycles
- Easier rollback and recovery
